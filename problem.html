            <h2>Global warming</h2>
            <p>
                In the past 50 years the world has seen a rapid increase in global warming.
                If nothing is done, we can expect to see changes such as a 10-degree Fahrenheit increase in the US over the next century.<a href="./sources.html#global-warming-101" class="source"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
                This rise in global warming is largely due to greenhouse gasses like Co2 and other air pollutants.
                These gasses are made by burning fossil fuel for electricity, transportation running on fossil fuel, industrial processes, and electronic waste.<a href="./sources.html#sources-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions" class="source"><sup>[9]</sup></a>

            <h2>Electronic waste</h2>
            <p>
                Disposal of electronic waste is a contributing factor to increasing the world’s greenhouse gasses. Electronic waste releases toxins into soil and water, and affects the air when burnt or left to decompose.
                In high concentration, these toxins are harmful to both humans and wildlife.<a href="./sources.html#electronic waste-and-how-to-reduce-it" class="source"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The effects aren't immideately visible to the naked eye, due to the toxins being situated in the soil and left develop over time.

                    <p>
                        The waste management sector is a significant culprit, which contributes 3-5% of global greenhouse gas emissions alone.<a href="./sources.html#human-waste-processing" class="source"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
                        Electronic waste is unsafely disposed of by being transported to developing countries, where it's typically scavenged for useful materials before being burnt or buried.
                        Meanwhile, countries such as Norway top the electronic waste charts.<a href="./sources.html#worst-electronic-waste-offenders" class="source"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

            <h2>How to fight it</h2>
            <p>
                There are many ways to combat the growing electronic waste, and different measures have been implemented.
                In the US they have started to create incentives for designing environmentally friendly electronics, and effective waste management.
                In Japan they split the responsibility between manufacturers and consumers, where the manufacturers of computers and small appliances need to provide proper recycling facilities, and the consumers must pay for the transport and recycling of home appliances like TV’s and refrigerators.<a href="./sources.html#electronic waste-and-how-to-reduce-it" class="source"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                These solutions focus on the recycling and disposal of electronic waste, but our solution is more focused on preventing technology from being thrown away before it’s necessary.
                We will do that by encouraging people to fix their own devices, by making spare parts more available, and providing the necessary knowledge to take something apart and fixing it.
