            <h2>Global warming</h2>
            <p>
                In the past 50 years the world has seen a rapid increase in global warming. 
                If nothing is done, we can see changes such as a 10-degree Fahrenheit increase in the US over the next century. 
                This rise in global warming is largely due to greenhouse gasses like Co2 and other air pollutants. 
                These gasses are made by burning fossil fuel for electricity, transportation running on fossil fuel, industrial processes, and electronic waste <a href="./sources.html#global-warming-101" class="source"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.

            <h2>Electronic waste</h2>
            <p>
                Disposal of e-waste is a contributing factor to the world’s greenhouse gasses, for example by burning electronics, or by the electronic waste releasing toxins into the soil and water. 
                In high concentrations these toxins are harmful to both humans and wildlife, but the effects are hard to notice because the toxins are situated in the soil and develops over time <a href="./sources.html#e-waste-and-how-to-reduce-it" class="source"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. <br> <br>
                The electronic waste is being spread across the world and is becoming a global problem as the amount of e-waste is increasing. 
                This waste is often disposed of in lower income countries, where it’s processed by underpaid workers or child labourers, and is often disposed of by burning the waste, which causes the toxic effects as mentioned earlier <a href="./sources.html#e-waste-and-how-to-reduce-it" class="source"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. 
                These countries have often little contribution to the actual electronic waste, while countries such as Norway tops the e-waste charts.

            <h2>How to fight it</h2>
            <p>
                There are many ways to combat the growing e-waste, and different measures have been implemented. 
                In the US they have started to create incentives for designing environmentally friendly electronics, and effective waste management. 
                In Japan they split the responsibility between manufacturers and consumers, where the manufacturers of computers and small appliances need to provide proper recycling facilities, and the consumers must pay for the transport and recycling of home appliances like TV’s and refrigerators <a href="./sources.html#e-waste-and-how-to-reduce-it" class="source"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. <br> <br>
                These solutions focus on the recycling and disposal of e-waste, but our solution is more focused on preventing technology from being thrown away before it’s necessary. 
                We will do that by encouraging people to fix their own devices, by making spare parts more available, and providing the necessary knowledge to take something apart and fixing it.
