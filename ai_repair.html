                    We believe that by empowering individuals to repair and construct electronics instead of buying and
                    throwing away, we can contribute to saving the environment. Read more about the United Nations'

                <p>
                    Glasses have long been a symbol for intelligence, but now we want to literally put intelligence in glasses.
                    A pair of glasses with two front-facing cameras, and laser technology, allows us to capture the reality in
                    front of the usser, and super-impose imagery that's helpful to the wearer when performing repairs.
