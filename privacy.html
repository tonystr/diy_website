            <h2>Does my data get sold/shared/publicised?</h2>
            <p>
                No. The AI is trained on our own data and voluntary testers, and only reacts to the video feed you provide it. The AI operates entirely locally, and only accesses the internet to look up guides and refer to our electronics database. You can opt-in to our test group, where you may choose to contribute data to improving the AI, but this is disabled by default. In other words, your private data is your private data, and it never leaves your device.
            </p>
            <h2>Why does the AI need access to camera and files?</h2>
            <p>
                The repair AI uses image-recognation to identify real-life objects. You can feed it single images, however it is a lot more accurate when operating on live camera feed, because it can see different angles, perceive depth, and correct for light issues. This requires a tremendous amount of memory, so instead of slowing your device to a halt, we ask to use a portion of your storage to store temporary data during use, which is later deleted.
            </p>
            <h2><abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Compliance</h2>
            <p>
                The software and this website are designed to wholly comply with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR is a regulation incorporated in EU law, which aims to return control over personal data to individuals, and to simplify the framework of restrictions for international business by standarizing the regulation in the EU.<a href="./sources.html#unifying-gdpr" class="source"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

            <h2>Personal data</h2>
            <p>
                You can request all your personal data stored on our servers to be sent to you through an email, and upon deleting your account, all of it is removed from our servers. Your data can not be read/accessed by anyone else than you, and is only stored to support basic functions like user accounts.
            </p>
            <h2>Any questions?</h2>
            <p>
                If you're wondering about something that neither this page nor the software's EULA answer, you may send us an email to <a href="mailto:support@diystuff.com" target="_blank">support@diystuff.com</a>, and we'll answer as soon as possible.
